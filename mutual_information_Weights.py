#=======================================================
# Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) is an adjustment of the Mutual Information (MI) score to account for chance.
# It accounts for the fact that the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number of clusters,
# regardless of whether there is actually more information shared. For two clusterings U and V, the AMI is given as:
#
# AMI(U, V) = [MI(U, V) - E(MI(U, V))] / [max(H(U), H(V)) - E(MI(U, V))]
#
# This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels: a permutation of the class or cluster label values
#  wonâ€™t change the score value in any way.

    # worsen the results.
